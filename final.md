## Motivation

- Relevance
    - Healthcare data critical to security
    - IoT and ubiquitous computing 
    - Data storage increasingly complex issue

- Goals
    - Study and compare access control protocols in healthcare industry
    - Survey applications of Blockchain in decentralized networks
    - Compare and contrast different protocols
        - Security
        - Usability
        - Cost

## Metrics

- Application Area - EHR, IoT data, billing, credentialing etc.
- Architecture - Centralized, Decentralized, Cloud, Hybrid etc.
- Blockchain Type - private, consortium, public
- Consensus - PoW, PoS, PoA, PBFT
- File Storage - on chain, IPFS, cloud
- Encryption - symmetric, asymmetric, combination
- Monetary Cost Structure
- Strengths - Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Interoperability, Implementation Effort
- Limitations - Scalability, Performance, Cost, Complexity

Notes:

- Monetary cost - who takes on the monetary cost of maintaining the decentralized network
- Data Ownership, Access Control??

## Comparison of Applications

![](./table1.png)

Notes:

- BlockMedCare relies on trusted hospital nodes to form consensus through proof-of-authority
    - requires those servers to keep the network alive
    - others can keep a copy of shared state but that is just replication
- Healthchain does not clearly define cost structure
    - ultimately passes cost to patients through PoW
- Holochain is not blockchain
    - uses distributed ledger to create local consensus among peers
    - peers validate and sign transactions that can be later verified
- Albalwy created an access management system
    - everything is centralized except authorization data
- Daidone
    - no storage, central or decentralized
    - users keep their own data
    - share on-demand through secure P2P channels off-the-chain

## Comparison of Applications

![](./table2.png)

Notes: 
- Attribute based signature scheme that utlizes a consortium blockchain for sharing and storing Electronic health records and ensuring that other doctors are credentialed before receiving EHR data.
- Stores data from health sensors on the blockchain where the hospital initializes all smart contracts for doctors and patients to monitor the patient's health.
- Utilizes an edge server for convenient local storage, distribute workloads geographically, and proxy external miner data. The global database is stored in the cloud.
- Utilizes a hybrid computing layer with a distributed topology including IPFS, cloud computing, edge computing. Where the edge computing topology takes on most of the computation and the cloud computing topology takes on most of the backup services.
- MedRec utilizes smart contracts to hold metadata regariding ownership, permissions, and data integrity. Utilizing a user's Ethereum address, the authors created a syncing algorithm to handle data enchanges that occur off-chain so that patient and provide databases are synced.

## Conclusion

- Blockchains
    - ✅ Integrity => Public Ledger
    - ✅ Availability => Massive Replication
    - ❌ Confidentiality
- Global consensus often not necessary => Holochain
- Centralized Systems hard to replace
- Monetary flow ultimately drives success

Notes:

- Integrity => Public Ledger
- Availability => replicate everything everywhere
- does not provide Confidentiality - except through use of PKI
- when would you actually need every system in the world to agree on something?
- lots of organizations chase the buzzword
- Centralized systems exist for a reason

---

## Discussion
- Proof-of-Authority => semi-centralized or centralized architecture
- Proof-of-Work is computationally expensive
- IPFS does not guarantee file availability
- Difficult to implement fully decentralized networks

Notes:
- IPFS necessitates encryption of data, but does not guarantee there will be no data leakage
    - still requires someone to bear the cost
    - have to ensure that files aren't being purged
- Fully decentralized networks can be difficult to implement:
    - localized storage can be quickly accessed in hospital scenarios
    - more affordable to maintain 
    - centralized systems easier to deploy
