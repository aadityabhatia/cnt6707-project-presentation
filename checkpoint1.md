## Motivation

- Ariel Turnley
	- Background: Computer Science
	- Research Interests: Healthcare IoT, Network Security

- Sonny Bhatia
	- Background: Cybersecurity
	- Research Interests: Blockchain, IoT

- Relevance
	- Healthcare data critical to privacy
	- IoT and ubiquitous computing
	- Policy compliance is increasingly challenging

Notes:

Cue: Ariel will now talk about her background and motivation

Sonny
- Army officer in the Cyber branch
- Conducted several defensive cyberspace operations on large scale networks
- very interested in network security
- Decentralization critical to sustained operations in degraded environments
- blockchain ^
- IoT connects everything - military tech connected but systems don't always talk
- special technical expertise to maintain systems
- security issues are almost always due to organizational controls


- With new technology, it is important to ensure that healthcare IoT application networks are secure.
- Healthcare data is critical to privacy; little control over personal data presently
- IoT -> more data being collected; policy lagging but catching up
- Blockchain is a major enabler for decentralized access to information and resources.

## Goal

- Survey applications of Blockchain in decentralized healthcare networks
- Study and compare data sharing and access control protocols
	- Security
	- Usability
	- Cost
- Align with security policies and procedures
- Recommend technical and organizational controls to support novel protocols

Notes:

- Survey practical applications of Blockchain in decentralized networks
- Study and compare data sharing procedures and access control protocols in healthcare industry
- Find the alignment between new protocols and corresponding policies and procedures
	- e.g. Blockchain introduces new data controls
	- Policy compliance != security guarantees
- Compare and contrast different protocols with respect to
	- Security
	- Usability
	- Cost

Problem Statement: We intend to survey protocols used in access controls for healthcare data in centralized and decentralized setups.  We will consider current and proposed applications of Blockchain to manage data and access, and compare the balance between security, usability, and cost among different techniques.

## Plan of Action

- ☑ Gather research papers
- ☑ Read 4 survey papers
- ☑ Prepare authoring toolchain + paper outline
- ☐ Narrow scope
- ☐ Shortlist and select papers
- ☐ Find real-life applications of Blockchain in Healthcare
- ☐ Finalize considered metrics
- ☐ First draft
- ☐ Review process
- ☐ Paper complete

Notes:

- Gathered over 30 quality papers
- Analyze the methods of securing healthcare IoT networks, including the use of blockchain, protocols, etc.
- number of papers total vs read
- where we are
- metrics considered
- categorization

## Discussion

- Scoping
	- Assess different applications / study one in detail
	- Technical protocols / policy controls
- Centralized vs Decentralized applications

Notes:

- Feedback
- How to define scope?
- Elderly care vs hospital networks
