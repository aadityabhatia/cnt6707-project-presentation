## Motivation

- Ariel Turnley
	- Background: Computer Science
	- Research Interests: Healthcare IoT, Network Security

- Sonny Bhatia
	- Background: Cybersecurity
	- Research Interests: Blockchain, IoT

- Relevance
	- Healthcare data critical to privacy
	- IoT and ubiquitous computing
	- Policy compliance is increasingly challenging

Notes:

## Motivation

Cue: Ariel will now talk about her background and motivation

- Officers in the US Army in the Cyber branch
	- been on several cyberspace operations on large networks
	- very interested in network security
- Military operations in degraded environments
	- Decentralization critical -> blockchain ^
- IoT connects everything - military tech connected but systems don't always talk
	- need technical expertise to maintain systems
	- contracts and policy limits interoperability
	- security issues are almost always due to organizational controls

- Relevance
	- Healthcare data is critical to privacy
	- users have little control over personal data
	- IoT -> more data being collected; policy lagging but catching up
	- decentralized access to information, resources - Blockchain = major enabler
	- decided to put it all together

## Goal

- Survey applications of Blockchain in decentralized healthcare networks
- Study and compare data sharing and access control protocols
	- Security
	- Usability
	- Cost
- Align with security policies and procedures
- Recommend technical and organizational controls to support novel protocols

Notes:

## Goal
- Survey practical applications of Blockchain in decentralized networks
- Study and compare data sharing procedures and access control protocols in healthcare industry
- Find the alignment between new protocols and corresponding policies and procedures
	- e.g. Blockchain introduces new data controls
	- Policy compliance != security guarantees
- Compare and contrast different protocols with respect to
	- Security
	- Usability
	- Cost

Problem Statement: We intend to survey protocols used in access controls for healthcare data in centralized and decentralized setups.  We will consider current and proposed applications of Blockchain to manage data and access, and compare the balance between security, usability, and cost among different techniques.

## Plan of Action

- ☑ Gather research papers
- ☑ Read 4 survey papers
- ☑ Prepare authoring toolchain + paper outline
- ☐ Narrow scope
- ☐ Shortlist and select papers
- ☐ Find real-life applications of Blockchain in Healthcare
- ☐ Finalize metrics
- ☐ First draft
- ☐ Review process
- ☐ Paper complete

Notes:

## Plan of Action

- Gathered over 30 quality papers
- Analyze the methods of securing healthcare IoT networks, including the use of blockchain, protocols, etc.
- number of papers total vs read
- where we are
- metrics considered
- categorization

Notes:

## Papers Being Considered

- Going to discuss our top two papers so far
- Caring About IoT-Security
	- based on interviews of industry experts
	- highlights security vulnerabilities in processes
	- security awareness campaigns lack action
	- regulation
		- helped standardize industry
		- forced manufacturers to improve security
		- german law - backdoors
	- Usable security - a device or network’s security must be compatible with the behaviors of anyone using it
	- considers technical and organizational factors
		- interconnected
		- how each impacts overall security
	- lack of trust and transparency

- Cue: Ariel will discuss the second paper

## Discussion

- Scoping
	- Assess different applications / study one in detail
	- Technical protocols / policy controls
	- Centralized vs decentralized applications
- Selecting metrics - how broad or specific?
- Paper selection criteria

Notes:

## Discussion
- How to define scope?
- Assess different applications / study one in detail
	- Elderly care vs hospital networks
	- how much should we focus on technical protocols vs policy controls
- Centralized vs decentralized applications
	- blockchain has limited adoption
	- should we consider existing systems or focus on new and upcoming

- Feedback is welcome
